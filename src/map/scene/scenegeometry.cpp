/* the algorithm in here would be pretty simple (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon#Centroid)
 * if it weren't for numeric stability. We need something that keeps sufficient precision (~7 digits)
 * in the range of +/- m * nÂ² for n being the largest coordinate value, and m the polygon size.
 * To help with that we:
 * - move the polygon bbox center to 0/0. This works as we usually only look at very small areas.
 * - scale the value by the bbox size, to enable the use of 64bit integers for the intermediate values.
 * - use 64 bit integers for the intermediate values, as those contain squares of the coordinates
 *   and thus become very large. As we don't use divisions on the intermediate values, integers work for this.
